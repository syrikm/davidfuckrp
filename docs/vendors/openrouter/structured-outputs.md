OpenRouter supports structured outputs for compatible models, ensuring responses follow a specific JSON Schema format. This feature is particularly useful when you need consistent, well-formatted responses that can be reliably parsed by your application.

## Overview

Structured outputs allow you to:

- Enforce specific JSON Schema validation on model responses
- Get consistent, type-safe outputs
- Avoid parsing errors and hallucinated fields
- Simplify response handling in your application

## Using Structured Outputs

To use structured outputs, include a `response_format` parameter in your request, with `type` set to `json_schema` and the `json_schema` object containing your schema:

```
{
  "messages": [\
    { "role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in London?" }\
  ],
  "response_format": {
    "type": "json_schema",
    "json_schema": {
      "name": "weather",
      "strict": true,
      "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "location": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "City or location name"
          },
          "temperature": {
            "type": "number",
            "description": "Temperature in Celsius"
          },
          "conditions": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Weather conditions description"
          }
        },
        "required": ["location", "temperature", "conditions"],
        "additionalProperties": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The model will respond with a JSON object that strictly follows your schema:

```
{
  "location": "London",
  "temperature": 18,
  "conditions": "Partly cloudy with light drizzle"
}
```

## Model Support

Structured outputs are supported by select models.

You can find a list of models that support structured outputs on the [models page](https://openrouter.ai/models?order=newest&supported_parameters=structured_outputs).

- OpenAI models (GPT-4o and later versions) [Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs)
- Google Gemini models [Docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/structured-output)
- Anthropic models (Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.1+) [Docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/structured-outputs)
- Most open-source models
- All Fireworks provided models [Docs](https://docs.fireworks.ai/structured-responses/structured-response-formatting#structured-response-modes)

To ensure your chosen model supports structured outputs:

1. Check the model’s supported parameters on the [models page](https://openrouter.ai/models)
2. Set `require_parameters: true` in your provider preferences (see [Provider Routing](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/routing/provider-selection))
3. Include `response_format` and set `type: json_schema` in the required parameters

## Best Practices

1. **Include descriptions**: Add clear descriptions to your schema properties to guide the model

2. **Use strict mode**: Always set `strict: true` to ensure the model follows your schema exactly


## Example Implementation

Here’s a complete example using the Fetch API:

TypeScript SDKPythonTypeScript (fetch)

```
import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';

const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
  apiKey: '<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
});

const response = await openRouter.chat.send({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
  messages: [\
    { role: 'user', content: 'What is the weather like in London?' },\
  ],
  responseFormat: {
    type: 'json_schema',
    jsonSchema: {
      name: 'weather',
      strict: true,
      schema: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          location: {
            type: 'string',
            description: 'City or location name',
          },
          temperature: {
            type: 'number',
            description: 'Temperature in Celsius',
          },
          conditions: {
            type: 'string',
            description: 'Weather conditions description',
          },
        },
        required: ['location', 'temperature', 'conditions'],
        additionalProperties: false,
      },
    },
  },
  stream: false,
});

const weatherInfo = response.choices[0].message.content;
```

## Streaming with Structured Outputs

Structured outputs are also supported with streaming responses. The model will stream valid partial JSON that, when complete, forms a valid response matching your schema.

To enable streaming with structured outputs, simply add `stream: true` to your request:

```
{
  "stream": true,
  "response_format": {
    "type": "json_schema",
    // ... rest of your schema
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

When using structured outputs, you may encounter these scenarios:

1. **Model doesn’t support structured outputs**: The request will fail with an error indicating lack of support
2. **Invalid schema**: The model will return an error if your JSON Schema is invalid

## Response Healing

For non-streaming requests using `response_format` with `type: "json_schema"`, you can enable the [Response Healing](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/features/plugins/response-healing) plugin to reduce the risk of invalid JSON when models return imperfect formatting. Learn more in the [Response Healing documentation](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/features/plugins/response-healing).
